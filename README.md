# Implementing Modern DevOps
This is the code repository for [Implementing Modern DevOps](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/implementing-modern-devops?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786466877), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book follows a unique approach to modern DevOps using cutting-edge tools and technologies such as Ansible, Kubernetes, and Google Cloud Platform.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapters 1, 3, and 9 does not have any code files.

The code will look like the following:
```
resource "google_compute_address" "my-first-ip" {
  name = "static-ip-address"
}
```

In order to follow this book and its contents, you will need a trial account on Google Cloud Platform and an editor (I used Atom but any other editor will work) as well as Node.js installed on your local machine. You will also need to install Docker locally in order to test the different examples. We will use Google Container Engine (GKE)for the Kubernetes examples but if you want to play locally with Kubernetes, Minikube can also be used, although you need a fairly powerful computer.
